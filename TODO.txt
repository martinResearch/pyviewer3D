a strange thing is that if i display edges of the triangle in a different color, then edges segment are  antialiased
	
make the cutting plane panel removable

display edges only on the edges on the polygon , not on edges between two triangles part of the same polygon
	vtk has polygons ("The polygons cannot have any internal holes"  http://www.vtk.org/doc/release/5.0/html/a01894.html) but does not wllow holes in the polygon....
	will have to create polyline actors : http://www.vtk.org/doc/release/5.0/html/a01895.html
	
writing a new camera interaction style that keeps the horizon line horizontal (or vertical of the model vetical)
