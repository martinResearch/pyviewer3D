a strange thing is that if i display edges of the triangle , then edges segment are then antialiased
	
make the cutting plane panel removable

display edges only on the edges on the polygon , not on edges btween two triangles part of the same polygon
	vtk has polygons ("The polygons cannot have any internal holes"  http://www.vtk.org/doc/release/5.0/html/a01894.html) but does not wllow holes in the polygon....
	will have to create polyline actors : http://www.vtk.org/doc/release/5.0/html/a01895.html
